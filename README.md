# STM32 F9P GNSS Data Logger

Low-cost STM32-based raw GNSS logger for u-blox ZED-F9P receivers. The logger records a raw UBX stream to an SD card for later PPK processing, while a small SSD1306 OLED shows live write status, file name, fix state, satellite count, UTC time, and overrun warnings.

This project was built around an STM32F407ZGT6 board with SDIO SD card access, FatFS, UART DMA receive, and a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED.

## What It Does

- Logs the incoming F9P UBX byte stream from UART1 directly to SD card.
- Creates incrementing files such as `GNSS001.UBX`, `GNSS002.UBX`, and so on.
- Uses UART DMA circular buffering to reduce packet loss risk.
- Displays SD write status and overrun warnings on OLED.
- Parses `UBX-NAV-PVT` passively for UTC time, fix type, and satellite count.
- Uses GNSS UTC time for FatFS file timestamps once valid time is available.

## Prerequisites

Install the STM32 development tools from STMicroelectronics:

- STM32CubeMX
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32CubeProgrammer

Download them from the official ST website:

https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools.html

Install u-blox u-center for configuring and testing the ZED-F9P:

- u-center GNSS evaluation software

Download from u-blox:

https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center

Recommended workflow:

- Use STM32CubeMX to inspect or regenerate peripheral configuration.
- Use STM32CubeIDE to build/import the firmware project.
- Use STM32CubeProgrammer to flash the compiled firmware to the STM32 board.
  -NOTE: BOOT0 jumper must be soldered in order to flash board, then unsoldered to run program. Recommend install of a switch or two wires to simplify multiple flashes of board
- Use u-center to configure the F9P output messages and verify `.UBX` log playback.
- Insert FAT32 formatted SD card into onboard STM32 slot.

## Recommended F9P Output Messages

For PPK logging, enable on UART 1 (or whichever is connected output to STM32 board):

- `UBX-RXM-RAWX`
- `UBX-RXM-SFRBX`
- `UBX-NAV-PVT` at 1 Hz

Optional:

- `UBX-NAV-SAT` at 1 Hz for richer satellite diagnostics

Disable unnecessary NMEA and high-rate navigation messages unless you have confirmed the UART and SD write pipeline have enough bandwidth.

## Current Baud Note

The current working setup has been left unchanged because it logs successfully. A future improvement is to raise the F9P UART and STM32 USART baud rate together, likely to `460800`, for more headroom.

Do not change only one side. The F9P UART baud and STM32 USART baud must match.

## OLED Logging Screen

Typical logging screen:

```text
SD WRITE 55KB OK

GNSS001.UBX

LOGGING || 03:42

SAT=18 3D
     UTC=18:24:11
```

Warnings:

- `WARNING OVERRUN`: UART receive/write pipeline fell behind. The log may have dropped bytes.
- `NO GNSS DATA`: no recent valid `NAV-PVT` packet has been parsed.
- Fix type flashes if the solution is not acceptable for PPK.

## Optional External New-Log Button

The onboard FK407M2-ZGT6 `KEY` button was not reliable as a readable GPIO during testing. Button-triggered file rotation is disabled by default.

The firmware includes a disabled compile-time option for a future external momentary switch. Wire a switch between a confirmed-free GPIO header pin and GND, then enable the option in `main.c`:

```c
#define BUTTON_ROTATE_LOG_ENABLED 1
#define BUTTON_ROTATE_LOG_PORT GPIOE
#define BUTTON_ROTATE_LOG_PIN GPIO_PIN_4
```

The firmware configures the selected pin with `GPIO_PULLUP`, so the button press pulls the pin low.

## Important Reliability Notes

- For PPK, dropped bytes matter. Watch `WARNING OVERRUN`.
- Use a good SD card and avoid removing power before writes are synced.
- Keep unnecessary receiver messages disabled.
- Confirm logged `.UBX` files open correctly in u-center before relying on field data.
- Long-duration testing is strongly recommended before survey use.

## Repository Status

This is an early public-draft project. The firmware has been tested enough to log UBX files that play back in u-center, but the docs and reproducibility steps still need cleanup before a polished release.
